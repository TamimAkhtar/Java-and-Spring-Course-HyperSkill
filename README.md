This repository is for all projects from the Hyperskill Java Backend Development course with Spring. While I did not do all projects offered in the course, I think learning through doing these projects was a great learning experience for me.

Learn a few topics - Apply these via a project - Choose a new Project - Repeat

The projects are as follows:

1. Coffee Machine Simulator

2. Bulls and Cows game

3. Traffic Light Simulator

4. Simple Banking system

5. BattleShip game

6. JSON Database

To keep this repository only code-friendly, more information regarding the project details and things I learnt can be accessed from my portfolio below:
